# Lecture 10: Scalable Stream Processing

In this lecture, we will review Distributed stream processing and how those platforms could interact with Deep Learning frameworks in order to maximize the use of resources, among the topics to overview we have Apache Spark, InterlBigDL, Caffe on Spark, TensorFlow on Spark and distributed storage.
