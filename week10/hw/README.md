# Reinforcement learning introduction.

Do you remember when your teacher at primary school gave you stars when doing your initial projects?, that is one of the keys factors in Reinforcement Learning.

Basically the system is trying to make optimal decisions using it's own experiences, by observing the environment and deciding how to act according to an strategy, while in the process receives a reward or a penalty.

In this initial homework we will be using a DQN (Deep Q Networks) agent training using the TF-Agents library, this example is run inside the Google Colab [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)

Please access the following notebook: [DQN](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/agents/blob/master/docs/tutorials/1_dqn_tutorial.ipynb)

Document your results, Please upload your training videos to ISVC.
