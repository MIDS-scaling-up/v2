# Homework 6: 
## Part 1.  Image Annotation
For this homework, you will be annotating the Millennium Falcon and TIE Fighters in images from Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  

The Millennium Falcon
![Image of the Millennium Falcon](./falcon.jpg)


Three TIE Fighters
![Image of the Millennium Falcon](./fighters.jpg)


Annotations for an image include the object coordinates and the corresponding label or class.
For example, an image with two TIE Fighters will have an annotation similar to:

```xml
<annotation>
    <folder>images</folder>
    <filename>image1.jpg</filename>
    <size>
        <width>1000</width>
        <height>563</height>
    </size>
    <segmented>0</segmented>
    <object>
        <name>Tie Fighter</name>
        <bndbox>
            <xmin>112</xmin>
            <ymin>281</ymin>
            <xmax>122</xmax>
            <ymax>291</ymax>
        </bndbox>
    </object>
    <object>
        <name>Tie Fighter</name>
        <bndbox>
            <xmin>87</xmin>
            <ymin>260</ymin>
            <xmax>95</xmax>
            <ymax>268</ymax>
        </bndbox>
    </object>
</annotation>

```
Spending no more than 3 hours, annotate images, identifying the Millennium Falcon and TIE Fighters.   You will want to use an image tool such as labelImg (https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) or RectLabel (macOS only, available in the App Store) and export the annotations in the PASCAL VOC format.  As this requires the user of a user interface, it is recommended that your normal workstation be used.

Images should be annotated with the following rules:

* Rule 1: Include all visible part and draw as tightly as possible.
* Rule 2: If multiple instances, label all instances.
* Rule 3: Occluded parts do not matter as long as all visible parts are included.

Steps (Assuming labelImg):
1. Install the tool, following the steps on https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg
2. Clone the repository https://github.com/rdejana/MIDS_HW8 into a working directory, e.g. /Users/rdejana/Documents/Homework.  In the subdirectory IDS_HW8/images/, you'll find the images that you'll be annotating.  
3. Create a directory that'll be used to store the annotations, for example /Users/rdejana/Documents/Homework/MIDS_HW8/annotations.
4. Start lalbeImg
5. Click "Open Dir" and select the images directory, e.g. Users/rdejana/Documents/Homework/MIDS_HW8/images
6. Make sure that PascalVOC is displayed under the "Save" icon.
7. Click "Change Save Dir" and set it to your annonations directory.
8. Start annotating.  Select "Create RectBox" and draw the bounds around any instances of Millennium Falcon or TIE Fighers you see in the image, adding the correct label.  When done with an image, press "Save".  Continue on to the next image repeating the process until complete or your reach the time limit.


Questions: 
1.	In the time allowed, how many images did you annotate?  
2.	Home many instances of the Millennium Falcon did you annotate?  How many TIE Fighters?
3.	Based on this experience,  how would you handle the annotation of large image data set?
4.	Think about image augmentation?  How would augmentations such as flip, rotation, scale, cropping, and translation effect the annotations?

## Part 2 Image Augmentation


## What to turn  in
### Part 1
1. A zip or tar file of your annoations.
2. Your answers to questions 1 through 4. 

### Part 2
For part 2, you will need to install docker in a VM or your local workstation.  

1. Run the command:
```bash
        docker run -d -P 8888:8888 <docker image>
```
2. If using a VM, open your browser to ```http://<<yourPublicIP>>:8888``` or if local, ```http://127.0.0.1:8888/```
