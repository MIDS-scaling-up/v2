# Lecture 12: All about storage

As we're sure you figured out by now, storage is critical to Deep Learning.  It's cost and performance will directly impact what you can and can't do with the enormous data sets you have. We will provide an overview of different types of  storage applicable for Big Data, distributed compute and Deep Learning platforms, overview of the Hadoop Distributed File System, overview of  parallel file systems and also an overview of Openstack Object Storage Swift
